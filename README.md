# JavaScript server tests with Node and Bun

Two apps. Two servers. Only one winner! Maybe, it kinda depends on the results I guess ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

## Get Started


## Todo

- [x] Add CPU and RAM limits to `Dockerfile`s
- [ ] Add some interesting functionality to the servers. Maybe some `sqrt` calcs in one route, and some sync timeouts in another?
- [ ] Add timers to those above
- [ ] Set up a test runner. JMeter is maybe overkill,
